<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yingluck, and I am 28 years old. I've worked as a Medical Technologist at a Military Hospital for six years, having graduated from Thammasat University. I genuinely enjoy my current job; it feels like a safe zone. I have a wonderful boss who I get along with well, and two supportive colleagues. My work is largely routine, meaning tasks are completed daily, and I don't have to bring work home. There's also minimal pressure from patients or others since we work primarily in our lab. Plus, my workplace is only 12 minutes from home, allowing me to see my parents almost every day if I don't work overtime.

Despite my satisfaction, I feel a lack of passion in other areas of my life. I dream of traveling abroad twice a year, taking my parents with me, and continuously improving myself. </p>

<p>In my free time, I love discussing MBTI with ChatGPT. It's always fun trying to figure out the reasons behind its and my own MBTI behaviors. I'm quite obsessed with it, and my MBTI type is INFP. I'm still trying to understand how much this theory truly works.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've been using ChatGPT to help me identify a career that truly aligns with my personality and goals. It suggested software development, which led me here to learn HTML and create this webpages. I'm currently taking a web development course from Teacher Angela Yu on Udemy, and she's an excellent instructor. Right now, I'm really enjoying this learning process. I'm not sure how far I'll go with it, but I hope to do my best, love this path I've chosen, and not give up.</p>
